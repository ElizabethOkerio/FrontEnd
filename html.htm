                <p>There were two python programming tasks on Andelabs. The first programming task 
				required us to write a binary search function that loops through an array of numbers, 
				searches for a certain number then returns a dictionary with count:index(key-value pairs).
				where count is the number of items your function iterated to find the index of number in question
				and index is the index of number in question.</p>

                <p>Here, we were required to come up with a design in html and CSS. 
				The design was to be used to gauge our front-end skills. We were then to put our designs in github repo. We had
				several options to choose from here. We were for instance allowed to clone another website to our repositories and make changes to it.
				We could also do it from scratch. It was all up to us.</p>

                <p>This task required us to write a blog post detailing the day's activities. Like what we were able to accomplish
				and how the day was generally. This was one of the interesting tasks for me throughout the period. This is because 
				it did not have any rules. All you were required to do is write about everything and anything about the experience
				but make your blog professional.</p>

						<h3>Trello Board</h3>
						<p>The Trello Board resource had all the tasks that we were required to do for the day.
						I definately loved it. It was a good one for assigning tasks to people. 
						It had all the three-day tasks. We were to work on each day's task and tick the completed tasks then provide a link to 
						out work in github.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-4 footer-blurb-item">
						<h3>Github</h3>
						<p>All through the three-day working from home time, we were only allowed to use github 
						to submit our work. That is, we were to create github repositories with our projects or tasks
						and provide our facilitators with the links to our github repo. That was whattsup if you ask me. </p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-4 footer-blurb-item">
						<h3>Slack</h3>
						<p>Slack was the major communicating channel that we were using throughout this period.
                           It was efficient and helpful. This is because we could communicate with others easily
                           and efficiently. I can say it was a good sharing platform.</p>
